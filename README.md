# HW12 C# Palindrome
Objective: Create a console application that will accept an input string from the user then display if the string is a palindrome or not.

1.	Create a solution called HW12
2.	Create a console project called HW12.Console
3.	All input and output will be done via the console window
4.	Prompt the user “Enter text to see if it’s a palindrome:”
5.	After displaying the results, the user should be continuously prompted for another text trial or enter “Exit” to quit.
6.	Each function will have a Try-Catch block.
7.	Subsequent functions will throw errors to the calling function.  Only the highest level function will display an error to the user if an exception is thrown.
8.	Test your application by entering “Racecar”, “radar”, and other text to ensure it works correctly


Please remember:
•	Use proper names for files and variables that would be meaningful to someone else having to modify your code.
•	Structure your code into proper size functions.  Each function should do a single task matching its name (action/verb).  
•	Use proper spacing and indentation so blocks of code are easily recognizable.
•	Output must be properly formatted and appear professional.
